# fISHbot

Revival of my first ever project. See the [original](https://github.com/konstfish/fISHbot/tree/original) branch for the source code from 2017. Recently rediscovered the code & since most of the old Discord API was deprecated & my bot didn't work anymore I took this as a chance to learn Cloudflare workers & familiarize myself with serverless. See the [cloudflare-workers](https://github.com/konstfish/fISHbot/tree/cloudflare-workers?tab=readme-ov-file) branch for that. The interactions API by itself unfortunately didn't give the bot the whole original functionality so I decided to again, take this as an opportunity to learn something new, so I rewrote everything in Go.

Add the bot: https://fishbot.konstfish.workers.dev/
